# Raytracing 101

## Description

This is a small project made to discover rust by implementing a basic raytracer. This is a work in progress so I'll try to add small features one at a time.  

So far I've implemented the ray/sphere intersection algorithm. This is a rough draft so it needs some refactoring and cleaning.

## Next steps
- lighting with diffuse and specular reflection
- shadows
- different object shapes
- textures
- interactively moving the camera around the scene
